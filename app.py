    ## Details

    This is an app to transform S3 URI to HTTPS URL. Working with S3 URIs could be annoying for us, ordinary people, while engineers keep using them like they have no idea it does not just open in the browser. 
    The app is designed with anger and annoyment, but also with love to people.
